# Calculate carbonate sediment thickness

Generate carbonate sediment thickness grids from age and bathymetry grids over the time range 0-170Ma (in 1My increments). Pelagic carbonate sediments did not exist before 170Ma.

## Dependencies

- [GMT](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/download/) (and make sure the 'gmt' executable is in the PATH).
- [PyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/pygplates_getting_started.html#installation).
- SciPy.
- And, on Windows platforms, optionally install [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) so that this workflow can use CPU cores in the *background* (ie, below-normal priority).

## Usage

To generate the carbonate thickness grids you can either:

- load the Jupyter notebook `carbonate_sediment_thickness.ipynb` and run all cells, or
- type `python run_carbonate_sediment_thickness.py` in a console/terminal window.

In either case there are a bunch of top-level parameters that you can change/configure.
By default `use_all_cpu_cores` is set to `True` to run on all CPU cores
(otherwise it takes too long; up to 25 hours at 0.5 degree resolution using just a single core).
Note that you can increase the `grid_spacing` parameter to reduce the running time.

> **Note:** If you choose the Jupyter notebook *and* you edit a parameter *outside* the notebook
(such as inside the imported module *carbonate_sediment_thickness*) then you'll need to restart the notebook kernel
after each modification (or insert `reload(carbonate_sediment_thickness)` after `import carbonate_sediment_thickness`).

The location of the age and bathymetry will need to be changed to point to your local grids.

The age grids can be downloaded from https://www.earthbyte.org/webdav/ftp/Data_Collections/Muller_etal_2019_Tectonics/Muller_etal_2019_Agegrids/Muller_etal_2019_Tectonics_v2.0_netCDF.zip .

The bathymetry grids can be downloaded from https://www.earthbyte.org/webdav/ftp/Data_Collections/Wright_etal_2020_ESR/Grids/Paleobathymetry_RHCW18/ .

You can either use the supplied topological model (in local directory `input_data/topology_model/2019_v2/`) or provide your own. If you're using the supplied model then you don't need to do anything. If you're providing your own model then you'll need to list your rotation and topology files in the `rotation_filenames` and `topology_filenames` variables (in `carbonate_sediment_thickness.ipynb` or `run_carbonate_sediment_thickness.py`). And note that you'll likely need to use *absolute* paths in your filenames (unlike the supplied model).
